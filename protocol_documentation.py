    Protocol Overview
    ----------------
    The Secure VANET Routing Protocol (SVRP) is a position-based reactive routing protocol
    designed specifically for vehicular networks with security as a primary concern.
    
    Key Features:
    1. Digital signature-based authentication using RSA-2048
    2. Multi-hash integrity verification (SHA-256, MD5, SHA-1, Blake2b, SHA3-256)
    3. Position-based forwarding with security checks
    4. Replay attack prevention through signature tracking
    5. Malicious node detection and isolation
    6. Battery and processing power awareness
    
    Message Types:
    - Beacon: Periodic status updates from vehicles
    - RREQ: Route Request for path discovery
    - RREP: Route Reply with path information
    - DATA: Actual data packets with integrity protection

    1. Route Discovery Process:
       
       Vehicle A                                               Vehicle B

    Key Advantages over Traditional Protocols:
    1. Built-in security from the ground up rather than as an afterthought
    2. Multi-layered integrity verification using different hash algorithms
    3. Explicit handling of malicious nodes and attack scenarios
    4. Performance metrics focused on both networking and security aspects
    5. Consideration of resource constraints (battery, processing power)

    Design Decisions and Justification
    ---------------------------------
    
    1. Choice of RSA-2048 for Digital Signatures:
       - Provides strong security with reasonable key size
       - Widely studied and implemented in various libraries
       - Separate keys for signing and verification supports non-repudiation
       - Trade-off: Higher computational cost compared to ECDSA
    
    2. Multiple Hash Functions:
       - Provides defense in depth against cryptographic weaknesses
       - Allows performance comparison and adaptation to device capabilities
       - Different hash functions have different security/performance profiles
       - Trade-off: Increased overhead for multiple hash calculations
    
    3. Reactive Routing with Position Awareness:
       - Reduces overhead compared to proactive protocols
       - Position information improves forwarding decisions in highly mobile scenarios
       - Only establishes routes when needed, saving bandwidth
       - Trade-off: Initial delay for route establishment
    
    4. Signature Tracking for Replay Prevention:
       - Simple yet effective mechanism to prevent replay attacks
       - Requires minimal storage compared to timestamp-based approaches
       - No need for tight clock synchronization between vehicles
       - Trade-off: Memory usage grows with number of received messages
    
    5. Resource Awareness:
       - Considers real-world constraints of vehicular systems
       - Adapts security measures based on available resources
       - Provides framework for energy-security trade-offs
       - Trade-off: Additional complexity in routing decisions
